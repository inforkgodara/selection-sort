# Selection Sort

A simple single class implementation of selection sort in Java. The user will be prompted to input the number of elements in a list array which they want to enter. The user then will choose a element to be sorted in the list. list array is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.

The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the left most element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary from one element to the right.

## How to use it.
* Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (SelectionSort.java).
* Type 'javac SelectionSort.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line.
* Now, type 'java SelectionSort' to run your program.
* You will be able to see a output line and asking input to enter number of elements (integer) you want to enter.
* Next you will enter number of element it can be space separated or in new line.
* After completion of entering elements in list, program will show sorted list.
